Restructure the local storage to have the form
localStorage[userName] = {0:{succesful: 2, fail: 3}, 1:{succesful: 3, fail: 1}... }

debug all of the stuff from last time. Doesn't seem to work perfectly.

add an overall progress bar:
    will necesitate an overall success rate function.

progress vis will be:

--Current number |=======|
--Overall         |=====|
--Last time       |======|


Next to do:
- Figure out how to get "last time" data and implement that into the viz as well. May actually not be needed... too much data.
- migrate repeated stuff to framesAfter == 100 conditional

For end product:
have a intro hand/hands be playful when user is signing in or registering
