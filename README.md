## CS228, UVM Fall 2014, Professor Josh Bongard

This repo houses all of my homework and project efforts for Professor Bongard's HCI class.

__DeliverablesX__ is directories storying fully self sustaining code for homework assignments. All is done in Python.

__threeLeep__ is a directory to hold all the stuff for my final project. All written in Javascript using d3.js, three.js and leap.js.
