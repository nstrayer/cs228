# To Do: 

* re-write file names so user is initially presented with the login screen: soâ€¦ 
	- welcome.html -> index.html, 
	- index.html -> game.html

* game.html will use code from test.html to grab the user info from localStorage and load it into a current JSON variable. The loop for controlling the game will be modified to write and read from this data-structure. A counter variable will be added somewhere in the GUI.
